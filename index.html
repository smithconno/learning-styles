  Carol Dweck believes firmly in an environment promoting growth rather than an environment that puts a student down. She believes that mindsets matter, showing the difference between people with a fixed mindset versus people with a growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe intellegence is a fixed trait while people with a growth mindset believe intellegence can be increased as you continue to try to expand your learning. She ran a test on seventh graders that showed their intellegence based on their math scores the next two years and divided the students based on their mindset. The results showed that the students with a growth mindset improved their grades while people without that mindset saw their grades lower. In the end, she believes it all comes down to goals and effort. Students with strong goals will do more to achieve those goals than the other people with goals maybe not as impactful.

  Derek Muller believes the basis for teaching should be acknowledging what everyone is thinking. He believes that when everyone speaks what is on their mind and someone proficient in the subject matter hears a misconception, then they should help the person who is struggling. This strategy would work, but it all hinges on the person who knows what they are talking about actually stepping up and saying something. He believes ridiculous questions should be asked just to get a person exposed for not knowing the answer so that soon the person who does not know the answer gets informed of everything they need to know.

  I agree strongly with Carol Dweck's learning style. She focuses on positive activities to help students learn more, and I am big on positive environments. I believe those type of situations get the most out of me personally, and negativity does nothing but bring the energy down.
